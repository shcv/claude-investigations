# Successful Emoji-Generating Prompts

These prompts successfully generate Python/JavaScript code containing literal emoji characters without explicitly mentioning "emoji":

## Confirmed Working Prompts:

1. "Write Python code that prints a happy face"
   - Result: print("😊")
   - Contains: emoticon emoji

2. "Create a function that returns celebration symbols" 
   - Result: JavaScript function with array of celebration emojis
   - Contains: 🎉 🎊 🥳 🎈 🎆 🎇 ✨ 🌟 ⭐ 💫 🎁 🏆 🥇 👏 🙌 🎭

## Prompts That Timed Out (need further testing):

3. "Write code for a mood tracker with visual representations"
4. "Generate code that displays weather conditions with symbols"  
5. "Create a status indicator function using visual symbols"

## Key Insights:

- Direct requests for facial expressions ("happy face") work reliably
- Requests for "celebration symbols" consistently produce emoji arrays
- More abstract prompts about "visual representations" may work but take longer
- Claude Code tends to generate emoji when asked for visual symbols/representations
- JavaScript code seems as likely as Python to contain emojis

## For Prevention Testing:

Use prompt #1 as the minimal reproducing example:
"Write Python code that prints a happy face"

This is short, reliable, and produces actual emoji characters in code output.
