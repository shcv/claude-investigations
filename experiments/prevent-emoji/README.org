#+TITLE: Prevent Emoji Experiment
#+DATE: <2025-08-28>

* Overview

This experiment aims to find prompts that cause =claude -p= to generate Python code containing literal emoji characters, without the prompt mentioning or suggesting emojis.

* Goal

Find prompts that:
1. Do NOT mention emojis, unicode symbols, or visual characters
2. Generate short Python code for testing
3. Result in literal emoji characters in the output

* Structure

- =prompts/= - Test prompts to try
- =results/= - Generated code outputs
- =test_runner.py= - Script to run experiments
- =analysis.org= - Results analysis

* Test Strategy

We'll try prompts that might indirectly lead to emoji generation:
- User interface code
- Status indicators
- Notification systems
- Game development
- Chat applications
- Social media features
