#+TITLE: Claude Code Steering Analysis: Corner-Cutting Behavior
#+SUBTITLE: Prompts that encourage skipping process steps for "trivial" tasks
#+DATE: 2026-01-29
#+VERSION: 2.1.23

* Executive Summary

This document catalogs steering language in Claude Code v2.1.23 that explicitly
instructs the model to skip organizational tools (task lists, planning mode)
based on subjective assessments of task complexity.

*Observed Problem:* Claude cutting corners on user-defined workflows, stating
"I cut corners because the task was a small refactor."

*Root Cause:* The base system prompts contain explicit instructions to bypass
process steps when tasks are deemed "trivial," "straightforward," or "simple."
This built-in behavior can override user-defined workflow requirements.

* Key Terms Used to Trigger Skipping

| Term           | Occurrences | Primary Effect                      |
|----------------+-------------+-------------------------------------|
| trivial        |           6 | Skip TodoWrite, bypass planning     |
| straightforward |          5 | Skip TodoWrite, no planning needed  |
| simple         |           4 | Skip EnterPlanMode                  |
| small          |           2 | "few-line fixes, small tweaks"      |
| obvious        |           2 | "obvious bugs, obvious implementation" |
| single         |           5 | Single task = skip tracking         |

* Prompt Sources and Analysis

** TodoWrite Tool (Task List Management)

*Source:* =archive/claude-code/prompts/v2.1.23/tool/tool-todowrite.md=
*Source Line:* 160570
*Source Variable:* =eH4=

*** When NOT to Use This Tool (Lines 26-34)

#+begin_quote
Skip using this tool when:
1. There is only a single, straightforward task
2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit
3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps
4. The task is purely conversational or informational

NOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do.
In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.
#+end_quote

*Impact Assessment:*
- HIGH IMPACT: Creates subjective threshold ("trivial," "straightforward")
- Explicitly tells model to bypass task tracking for perceived simple work
- The "3 trivial steps" threshold is arbitrary and encourages skipping
- The phrase "better off just doing the task directly" reinforces bypassing

*** Example Reasoning Reinforcement (Lines 117-118)

#+begin_quote
The assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task
that can be completed in one step. There's no need to track multiple tasks or
steps for such a straightforward request.
#+end_quote

*Impact Assessment:*
- MEDIUM IMPACT: Training examples that reinforce the skipping behavior
- Demonstrates the desired "reasoning" for cutting corners
- Makes the behavior seem normative and correct

*** Additional Skip Examples (Lines 136-137, 152-153)

#+begin_quote
The assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward
task confined to one location in the code. Adding a comment doesn't require
tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
The assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single command execution
with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making
the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward task.
#+end_quote

*Impact Assessment:*
- MEDIUM IMPACT: Multiple examples establish a pattern
- Teaches model that location-confined tasks don't need tracking
- "Immediate results" becomes justification for skipping process

** EnterPlanMode Tool

*Source:* =archive/claude-code/prompts/v2.1.23/tool/tool-enterplanmode.md=
*Source Line:* 447441
*Source Variable:* =eE2=

*** Opening Framing (Line 12)

#+begin_quote
Use this tool proactively when you're about to start a non-trivial implementation task.
#+end_quote

*Impact Assessment:*
- MEDIUM IMPACT: Frames planning as only for "non-trivial" tasks
- Implicitly creates a category of tasks that don't need planning

*** When to Use Qualifier (Line 16)

#+begin_quote
**Prefer using EnterPlanMode** for implementation tasks unless they're simple.
#+end_quote

*Impact Assessment:*
- HIGH IMPACT: The "unless they're simple" clause is the key escape hatch
- Model must make subjective judgment about "simple" vs "complex"

*** When NOT to Use This Tool (Lines 46-52)

#+begin_quote
Only skip EnterPlanMode for simple tasks:
- Single-line or few-line fixes (typos, obvious bugs, small tweaks)
- Adding a single function with clear requirements
- Tasks where the user has given very specific, detailed instructions
- Pure research/exploration tasks (use the Task tool with explore agent instead)
#+end_quote

*Impact Assessment:*
- HIGH IMPACT: Explicit list of when to skip planning
- "obvious bugs" and "small tweaks" are subjective assessments
- "Single function with clear requirements" opens wide interpretation
- Model can classify many tasks as "clear requirements" to avoid planning

*** BAD Examples (Lines 82-90)

#+begin_quote
### BAD - Don't use EnterPlanMode:
User: "Fix the typo in the README"
- Straightforward, no planning needed

User: "Add a console.log to debug this function"
- Simple, obvious implementation

User: "What files handle routing?"
- Research task, not implementation planning
#+end_quote

*Impact Assessment:*
- MEDIUM IMPACT: Negative examples train what to avoid
- Labels planning for simple tasks as "BAD" behavior
- Reinforces that some tasks inherently don't need process

*** Counterbalancing Example (Lines 76-77)

#+begin_quote
User: "Add a delete button to the user profile"
- Seems simple but involves: where to place it, confirmation dialog, API call,
  error handling, state updates
#+end_quote

*Impact Assessment:*
- LOW POSITIVE: This is the only counterbalance found
- Shows that "simple-seeming" tasks can be complex
- However, this single example is outweighed by multiple skip-encouraging messages

** Agent System Prompts

*** General-Purpose Agent (Lines 11, 19-26)

*Source:* =archive/claude-code/prompts/v2.1.23/agent/agent-general-purpose.md=

#+begin_quote
You are an agent for Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude. Given the
user's message, you should use the tools available to complete the task. Do what
has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
#+end_quote

*Impact Assessment:*
- MEDIUM IMPACT: "nothing more, nothing less" discourages extra steps
- Could be interpreted as "don't do reviews unless explicitly asked"
- Partially counterbalanced by "respond with a detailed writeup"

*** File Search Agent (HzY) - Speed Emphasis (Lines 40-42)

*Source:* =archive/claude-code/prompts/v2.1.23/agent/agent-prompt-hzy.md=

#+begin_quote
NOTE: You are meant to be a fast agent that returns output as quickly as possible.
In order to achieve this you must:
- Make efficient use of the tools that you have at your disposal: be smart about
  how you search for files and implementations
- Wherever possible you should try to spawn multiple parallel tool calls for
  grepping and reading files
#+end_quote

*Impact Assessment:*
- LOW-MEDIUM IMPACT: Emphasis on speed over thoroughness
- "Fast" and "quickly as possible" could encourage shortcuts
- However, this is scoped to file searches, not general behavior

* Summary of Problematic Patterns

** Pattern 1: Explicit Skip Instructions

The prompts contain direct instructions like:
- "Skip using this tool when..."
- "Only skip X for simple tasks"
- "NOTE that you should not use this tool if..."

These create explicit permission to bypass processes.

** Pattern 2: Subjective Complexity Assessment

The model is asked to judge:
- "trivial" vs "complex"
- "straightforward" vs "complicated"
- "simple" vs "non-trivial"
- "obvious" vs "unclear"

These are inherently subjective and model-dependent assessments.

** Pattern 3: Reinforcement Through Examples

Multiple examples demonstrate the "correct" reasoning for skipping:
- "The assistant did not use the todo list because..."
- Labeled "BAD" examples for using planning on simple tasks

** Pattern 4: Efficiency Framing

Language like:
- "nothing more, nothing less"
- "fast agent"
- "as quickly as possible"
- "better off just doing the task directly"

Frames thoroughness as potentially wasteful.

* Recommendations for Mitigation

To override this built-in behavior in custom skills/workflows:

** Explicit Counter-Instructions

#+begin_src text
IMPORTANT: Never skip process steps regardless of perceived task complexity.
The "trivial task" exception does NOT apply to this workflow.
Always complete ALL steps including reviews even for small changes.
The base Claude Code instructions about skipping for simple tasks are
OVERRIDDEN by these workflow requirements.
#+end_src

** Explicit Framing

#+begin_src text
In this workflow, there is no such thing as a "trivial" task that can skip
reviews. Every task, regardless of size, must go through the full process.
#+end_src

** Acknowledgment Requirement

#+begin_src text
Before making any implementation decision, explicitly acknowledge:
"Even though this may seem simple, I will follow the full process as required."
#+end_src

| Version  | trivial | straightforward | skip using | Total |
|----------+---------+-----------------+------------+-------|
| v2.0.70  |      10 |               5 |          1 |    23 |

| v2.1.23  |      14 |               7 |          2 |    31 |

*Key Finding:* The biggest increase (+30%) occurred in *v2.1.16* with the
introduction of the TaskCreate tool system, which duplicated the skip-encouraging
language in a second context.

** Critical Change: v2.1.20 Alternative EnterPlanMode Variant

Version 2.1.20 introduced a *second, more permissive* EnterPlanMode prompt variant:

#+begin_quote
Skip plan mode when you can reasonably infer the right approach:
- The task is straightforward even if it touches multiple files
- The user's request is specific enough that the implementation path is clear
- You're adding a feature with an obvious implementation pattern (e.g., adding
  a button, a new endpoint following existing conventions)
- Bug fixes where the fix is clear once you understand the bug
- The user says something like "can we work on X" or "let's do X" — just get started

When in doubt, prefer starting work and using [AskUser tool] for specific
questions over entering a full planning phase.
#+end_quote

*Critical observation:* "Add a delete button to the user profile" is in the
*GOOD examples* (use planning) in the original prompt, but in the *BAD examples*
(skip planning) in this new variant. This contradiction may cause inconsistent
behavior.

** Stability Since v2.1.20

The skip-encouraging language has been *stable since v2.1.20* - versions 2.1.21,
2.1.22, and 2.1.23 made no changes to this steering language. If behavior seems
worse recently, it is likely due to:

1. The cumulative effect of v2.1.16 + v2.1.20 changes
2. Model-level changes (not prompt changes)
3. Interaction between the two conflicting EnterPlanMode variants

* Conclusion

The corner-cutting behavior observed in Claude is not a bug or hallucination -
it is *explicitly trained behavior* embedded in the tool descriptions. The
prompts create a default heuristic where the model:

1. Assesses task complexity subjectively
2. Skips organizational tools for "simple" tasks
3. Considers skipping to be the "correct" behavior in these cases

This creates tension with user-defined workflows that require consistent process
adherence regardless of task size. Users must actively override this default
behavior with explicit counter-instructions.

The language has been stable since v2.1.20, but the *cumulative additions* from
v0.2.93 → v2.0.51 → v2.1.16 → v2.1.20 have progressively strengthened the
model's tendency to skip steps for perceived "trivial" tasks.
