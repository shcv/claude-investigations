# Changelog for version 1.0.82

## ðŸŽ¯ Highlights
Version 1.0.82 introduces real-time validation for Claude Code settings files, simplifies the permission system by removing complex shortcuts, and adds internal infrastructure for upcoming beta features. This is primarily a quality and stability release focused on preventing configuration errors.

## ðŸš€ New Features

### Settings File Validation
**What:** Real-time validation when editing `.claude/settings.json` and `.claude/settings.local.json` files
**How to use:**
```bash
# When you edit a settings file with invalid JSON or schema
claude edit .claude/settings.json
# If the edit would create invalid settings, you'll see:
# "Claude Code settings.json validation failed after edit"
# followed by specific errors and the full schema
```
**Details:**
- Validates JSON syntax before applying edits
- Checks against the official Claude Code settings schema
- Shows specific field paths and error messages when validation fails
- Provides the complete schema reference for troubleshooting
- Prevents invalid configurations from being saved

## ðŸ’ª Improvements

### Simplified Permission System
**What changed:** Removed complex permission shortcuts and modes
**Previous behavior:** Had "accept-project" mode and shift+a keyboard shortcut for batch permissions
**New behavior:** Streamlined to three clear options: accept-once, accept-session, or reject
**Impact:** Clearer and more predictable permission handling without confusing shortcuts

### Beta Feature Infrastructure
**What changed:** Added internal filtering for experimental features
**Previous behavior:** All experimental features handled uniformly
**New behavior:** Special handling for "interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14" and "context-1m-2025-08-07" features
**Impact:** Prepares for controlled rollout of beta features (not yet user-accessible)

### Input Context Preservation
**What changed:** Enhanced command processing to preserve preceding input blocks
**Previous behavior:** Commands might lose context from previous interactions
**New behavior:** Better preservation of conversation context when executing commands
**Impact:** More consistent behavior when using commands in longer conversations
