# Changelog for version 1.0.105

## ðŸŽ¯ Highlights
Enhanced cross-platform path handling with improved Windows support for file access validation, addressing compatibility issues on Windows systems.

## ðŸš€ Improvements

### Enhanced Windows Path Handling
**What:** Improved file path validation with proper Windows path support
**How it works:** The CLI now detects Windows environments and converts Windows-style paths to Unix format before performing security validation, ensuring consistent behavior across platforms.
**Details:**
- Automatically detects Windows platform using system detection
- Converts Windows paths using `cygpath -u` utility for accurate translation
- Maintains existing behavior on Unix/macOS systems
- Fixes path validation failures that could occur on Windows systems
- **Evidence**: `function Kn() at line 352958` enhanced with Windows detection and path conversion logic

### Import Optimization
**What:** Streamlined module imports for better performance
**Details:**
- Consolidated path module imports into a single destructured import
- Updated stream import to use specific PassThrough class
- Simplified process module import to only include required `cwd` function
- **Evidence**: Import reorganization at lines 361219, 407570, and 434309
