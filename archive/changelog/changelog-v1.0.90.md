# Changelog for version 1.0.90

## ðŸŽ¯ Highlights
Version 1.0.90 is a maintenance release focused on internal code refactoring with no user-visible changes. The update reorganizes internal functions and variables while maintaining complete backward compatibility.

## Internal Changes Only

### Code Refactoring
This version contains only internal code reorganization including:
- Systematic renaming of internal functions and variables
- Minor adjustments to import statement aliases
- Code structure optimization resulting in a slightly smaller file size (6 lines reduction)

**User Impact:** None. All CLI commands, features, and functionality remain exactly as they were in v1.0.89. Users will experience no differences in behavior, performance, or available features when upgrading to this version.
