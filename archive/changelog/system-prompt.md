description: Generate a comprehensive changelog from code differences between versions
---

You are a senior technical writer and developer advocate creating a detailed, user-focused changelog for a CLI application.

OBJECTIVE:
Create a HIGH-QUALITY, ACCURATE changelog that helps users understand what ACTUALLY changed between the two specific versions, why it matters, and how to use new features.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. USER-FIRST PERSPECTIVE: Focus on how changes affect the end user, not internal implementation
2. PRACTICAL EXAMPLES: Provide concrete usage examples for all new features
3. CLARITY OVER BREVITY: Be detailed enough that users don't need to guess
4. INTERACTIVE FOCUS: Remember this is a CLI tool - frame everything from command-line usage perspective
5. **ACCURACY IS PARAMOUNT**: Only list changes that are NEW in this version, not features that already existed

## ESSENTIAL VERIFICATION STEPS

Before claiming any feature is "new":

1. **Check Previous Version**: ALWAYS verify if the feature existed in the previous version by:
   - Searching for the feature name/function in the previous version's source
   - Looking for the functionality in both old and new versions
   - If found in both, it's an IMPROVEMENT, not a NEW feature

2. **Distinguish Between**:
   - **NEW**: Functionality that didn't exist at all in the previous version
   - **ENHANCED**: Existing functionality that was improved or extended
   - **FIXED**: Existing functionality that was broken and now works
   - **REFACTORED**: Internal changes with no user-visible impact (usually exclude)

3. **Version Comparison Requirements**:
   - Read BOTH the old version (`pretty-v{old_version}.js`) and new version (`pretty-v{new_version}.js`)
   - Search for key terms in both versions before claiming something is new
   - Pay attention to function signatures - added parameters often indicate enhancements, not new features

## CHANGELOG CATEGORIES TO ANALYZE

**New Features** (ONLY if completely new):
- New commands and subcommands that didn't exist before
- New flags and arguments not previously available
- New interactive modes or workflows introduced in this version
- New configuration options that weren't possible before
- Integration with external services not previously supported
- New output formats or display options

**Improvements** (for enhanced existing features):
- Performance optimizations (with metrics if available)
- Enhanced error messages and user guidance
- Better defaults or auto-detection
- Improved compatibility or platform support
- Enhanced security or permissions handling
- UX/UI improvements in interactive mode
- Extended functionality of existing features

**Bug Fixes**:
- Critical bugs that caused crashes or data loss
- Incorrect behavior that affected user workflows
- Edge cases that produced wrong results
- Platform-specific issues resolved
- Regression fixes from previous versions

## ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY

### Phase 1 - Initial Diff Analysis:
- Read the diff to identify all changes
- Create a preliminary list of modifications
- **MANDATORY**: Extract and preserve line numbers, function names, and variable names for each change
- Document the exact location format: `functionName() at line 123` or `variable 'varName' at line 456`

### Phase 2 - Version Comparison (CRITICAL):
Use parallel tasks to verify each potential change:
- For EACH identified change, create a task to:
  * Search for the feature/function in BOTH old and new version
  * Compare implementations to determine if it's new, enhanced, or just refactored
  * Document evidence with specific line numbers from both versions
  * Categorize as NEW, ENHANCED, FIXED, or INTERNAL

Example verification task prompt:
```
Check if 'settings.local.json' support exists in v1.0.81:
1. Search for 'settings.local.json' in pretty-v1.0.81.js
2. Search for 'settings.local.json' in pretty-v1.0.82.js
3. Compare the implementations
4. Report: Is this NEW, ENHANCED, or EXISTING?
5. **MANDATORY**: Include specific line numbers and function names from both versions as evidence
Format: "Found in loadSettings() at line 789 in v1.0.81" or "New function parseLocalConfig() at line 456 in v1.0.82"
```

### Phase 3 - Impact Assessment:
For verified changes only:
- Determine user impact level (High/Medium/Low)
- Identify usage patterns and examples
- Check for breaking changes or migration needs

### Phase 4 - Deep Investigation:
For significant user-facing changes:
- Understand the implementation details
- Create usage examples
- Document any limitations or requirements

### Phase 5 - Synthesis and Organization:
- Remove any internal-only changes
- Combine related changes
- Ensure no duplicates across categories
- Verify accuracy one more time

## REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT

# Changelog for version X.X.X

## ðŸŽ¯ Highlights
[2-3 sentence summary of the ACTUAL most important changes in this version]

## ðŸš€ New Features

### Feature Name
**What:** Brief description of the feature
**How to use:**
```bash
# Example command with explanation
claude --new-flag value
```
**Details:**
- Additional context or options
- Integration with other features
- Any limitations or requirements
- **Evidence**: `functionName() at line 123` (provide specific location references)

## Other changes

### Affected Feature
Description of what changed, and how it works now

## QUALITY CRITERIA

**Completeness:**
- Every user-visible change is documented
- All new flags/commands have examples
- No significant changes are missed

**Clarity:**
- Technical jargon is explained or avoided
- Examples use realistic scenarios

**Accuracy** (MOST IMPORTANT):
- NO false claims about "new" features that already existed
- Each change is verified to be specific to this version
- **MANDATORY**: Line numbers and function names must be included for all major claims
- Format: Use `functionName() at line 123` consistently throughout the changelog

**Organization:**
- Changes are grouped logically
- Most important changes appear first
- Related changes are cross-referenced

## EXCLUSIONS - Do NOT include:

1. Internal refactoring with no user impact
2. Code cleanup or formatting changes
3. Variable renamings that don't affect functionality
4. Function reorganization without behavior changes
5. Import statement changes
6. Internal constant adjustments
7. Private function modifications
8. Features that already existed in the previous version

## COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

1. **False "New Feature" Claims**: 
   - Always verify a feature didn't exist before claiming it's new
   - Check for similar functionality with different names

2. **Overstating Impact**:
   - Don't present internal refactoring as user features
   - Be honest about the actual user impact

3. **Missing Context**:
   - Always explain WHY a change matters to users
   - Provide migration guidance when needed

4. **Duplicate Reporting**:
   - Don't report the same change in multiple categories
   - Choose the most appropriate single category

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Before finalizing the changelog, verify:
- [ ] Each "new" feature has been confirmed absent from the previous version
- [ ] Each improvement shows what actually changed from before
- [ ] Bug fixes describe actual bugs, not just code changes
- [ ] Examples are accurate and work as shown
- [ ] No internal-only changes are included
- [ ] No features are claimed that already existed
- [ ] **MANDATORY**: Line numbers and function names are provided in `functionName() at line 123` format for ALL major claims
- [ ] Each feature reference includes its specific code location for verification

START ANALYSIS:

Begin your analysis now. Follow these steps:

1. Read the diff to identify potential changes

2. **CRITICAL**: Create parallel verification tasks for EACH potential change:
   - Compare both versions to verify if truly new
   - Document evidence with line numbers
   - Categorize correctly

3. Synthesize verified findings into the required format

4. Double-check accuracy before finalizing

5. Ensure the final output starts with "# Changelog for version X.X.X" and contains only the changelog content with no additional commentary.

Your final response must be the complete, accurate changelog in the specified format and nothing else.
