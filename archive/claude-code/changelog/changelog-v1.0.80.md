# Changelog for version 1.0.80

## Highlights
This maintenance release focuses on internal code improvements and refactoring. The output style customization feature has been temporarily disabled while the team works on improvements.

## New Features

*No new user-facing features in this release.*


### Code Quality and Performance
**What changed:** Internal refactoring of module imports and code organization
**Impact:** Improved code maintainability and potential minor performance improvements through better module loading patterns


### Disabled: Output Style Customization
- **Issue:** The output style feature (educational, hands-on modes) has been temporarily disabled
- **Cause:** The feature is undergoing improvements and has been disabled to prevent inconsistent behavior
- **Resolution:** The system now uses the default interaction style for all responses. Custom output styles configured in settings will not take effect until this feature is re-enabled in a future release

## Notes

This is a maintenance release focused on internal improvements. Users should not experience any breaking changes to the CLI interface or core functionality. The output style feature will return in a future update with improvements based on user feedback.
