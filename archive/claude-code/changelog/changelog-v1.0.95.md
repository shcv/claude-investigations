# Changelog for version 1.0.95

## Highlights
This is a maintenance release with internal code refactoring. No new features, improvements, or bug fixes affect user functionality.

### Code Refactoring
This version contains only internal minification updates:
- Renamed internal markdown parsing function from `nB1` to `nC1` 
- Updated minified variable names for stream and process imports
- No changes to functionality, behavior, or performance

**Note**: All changes in this version are purely internal and have no impact on CLI usage, features, or behavior. The codebase maintains 100% structural similarity with the previous version.
