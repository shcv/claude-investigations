@aws-sdk/credential-provider-node - defaultProvider::fromEnv WARNING:
    Multiple credential sources detected: 
    Both AWS_PROFILE and the pair AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID/AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY static credentials are set.
    This SDK will proceed with the AWS_PROFILE value.
    
    However, a future version may change this behavior to prefer the ENV static credentials.
    Please ensure that your environment only sets either the AWS_PROFILE or the
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID/AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY pair.
