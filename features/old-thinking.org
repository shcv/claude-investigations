#+TITLE: Claude Code Thinking Mode Token Budget System (Legacy)
#+DATE: 2025-08-29
#+OBSOLETE: v2.0.0

* OBSOLESCENCE NOTICE

*This document describes the legacy thinking system used in Claude Code v1.0.128 and earlier.*

*OBSOLETE AS OF:* Version 2.0.0
*REPLACED BY:* Simplified binary system (see ~features/thinking.org~)
*LAST VERSION USING THIS SYSTEM:* v1.0.128

** What Changed in v2.0.0

The multi-language, multi-tier thinking system was completely redesigned:

*Removed:*
- 8-language support (Japanese, Chinese, Spanish, French, German, Korean, Italian)
- 4-tier token budgets (HIGHEST, MIDDLE, BASIC, NONE)
- Dozens of trigger phrases per language
- Complex pattern matching with word boundary detection

*Added:*
- Single English keyword: "ultrathink"
- Binary system: ULTRATHINK (31,999 tokens) or NONE (0)
- Tab toggle for interactive control
- ~thinkingMetadata~ API for programmatic control
- ~alwaysThinkingEnabled~ user setting with persistence

*Retained:*
- ~MAX_THINKING_TOKENS~ environment variable override

See ~archive/changelog/changelog-v2.0.0.md~ for full migration details.

* Overview (Legacy System)

Claude Code implemented a hierarchical token budget system that allocated cognitive resources based on pattern matching across 8 languages. The system provided four distinct thinking levels (NONE, BASIC, MIDDLE, HIGHEST) with precise token allocations ranging from 0 to 31,999 tokens.

* Architecture

** Token Budget Constants
Located in =archive/pretty/pretty-v1.0.96.js:411705=

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
var Lh1 = { 
  HIGHEST: 31999,  // Maximum thinking capacity  
  MIDDLE: 10000,   // Medium thinking capacity
  BASIC: 4000,     // Basic thinking capacity
  NONE: 0          // No thinking mode
}
#+END_SRC

** Processing Pipeline

1. Extract text content from user messages
2. Normalize text (lowercase, remove "i think"/"we think")
3. Match against language-specific patterns using priority order
4. Return highest matching budget level
5. Apply environment variable overrides if present

* Environment Variable Control

** MAX_THINKING_TOKENS
Complete override of pattern detection system.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
export MAX_THINKING_TOKENS=15000
#+END_SRC

** Implementation
Located in =archive/pretty/pretty-v1.0.96.js:411832-411836=

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
function rv(A, B) {
  if (process.env.MAX_THINKING_TOKENS) {
    let Q = parseInt(process.env.MAX_THINKING_TOKENS, 10);
    if (Q > 0) J1("tengu_thinking", { provider: UN(), tokenCount: Q });
    return Q;
  }
  // fallback to pattern matching logic
}
#+END_SRC

* Multi-Language Pattern System

** Pattern Structure
Located in =archive/pretty/pretty-v1.0.96.js:411706-411830=

Each language defines patterns for four budget levels with optional word boundary enforcement.

** English Patterns

*** HIGHEST (31,999 tokens)
- "think harder" (word boundary)
- "think intensely" (word boundary)  
- "think longer" (word boundary)
- "think really hard" (word boundary)
- "think super hard" (word boundary)
- "think very hard" (word boundary)
- "ultrathink" (word boundary)

*** MIDDLE (10,000 tokens)
- "think about it" (word boundary)
- "think a lot" (word boundary)
- "think deeply" (word boundary)
- "think hard" (word boundary)
- "think more" (word boundary)
- "megathink" (word boundary)

*** BASIC (4,000 tokens)
- "think" (word boundary)

** Additional Languages

*** Japanese
- HIGHEST: 熟考, 深く考えて, しっかり考えて
- MIDDLE: もっと考えて, たくさん考えて, よく考えて, 長考
- BASIC: 考えて

*** Chinese
- HIGHEST: 多想一会, 深思, 仔细思考
- MIDDLE: 多想想, 好好想
- BASIC: 想, 思考

*** Spanish
- HIGHEST: piensa más, piensa mucho, piensa profundamente
- MIDDLE: piensa
- BASIC: pienso, pensando

*** French
- HIGHEST: réfléchis plus, réfléchis beaucoup, réfléchis profondément  
- MIDDLE: réfléchis
- BASIC: pense, réfléchir

*** German
- HIGHEST: denk mehr, denk gründlich, denk tief
- MIDDLE: denk nach, denk
- BASIC: denke, nachdenken

*** Korean  
- HIGHEST: 더 오래 생각, 깊이 생각, 심사숙고, 곰곰이 생각
- MIDDLE: 많이 생각, 더 생각, 잘 생각
- BASIC: 생각

*** Italian
- HIGHEST: pensa di più, pensa a lungo, pensa profondamente, rifletti a fondo
- MIDDLE: pensa, pensa molto, rifletti
- BASIC: penso, pensare, pensando, riflettere

* Pattern Matching Algorithm

** Core Matching Function
Located in =archive/pretty/pretty-v1.0.96.js:411867-411874=

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
function SN5(A, B) {
  for (let Q of Object.values(ON5)) {
    let Z = Q[B];
    for (let { pattern: G, needsWordBoundary: Y } of Z)
      if ((Y ? new RegExp(`\\b${G}\\b`) : new RegExp(G)).test(A)) return !0;
  }
  return !1;
}
#+END_SRC

** Budget Detection Logic
Located in =archive/pretty/pretty-v1.0.96.js:411858-411866=

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
function PN5(A) {
  let B = [
    ["HIGHEST", Lh1.HIGHEST],
    ["MIDDLE", Lh1.MIDDLE], 
    ["BASIC", Lh1.BASIC],
  ];
  for (let [Q, Z] of B) if (SN5(A, Q)) return Z;
  return Lh1.NONE;
}
#+END_SRC

** Priority Order
1. HIGHEST (31,999 tokens)
2. MIDDLE (10,000 tokens)  
3. BASIC (4,000 tokens)
4. NONE (0 tokens)

* Text Processing

** Content Extraction
Located in =archive/pretty/pretty-v1.0.96.js:411852-411857=

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
function TN5(A) {
  if (typeof A.message.content === "string") return A.message.content;
  return A.message.content
    .map((B) => (B.type === "text" ? B.text : ""))
    .join("");
}
#+END_SRC

** Normalization
Located in =archive/pretty/pretty-v1.0.96.js:411844-411847=

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
let B = TN5(A)
    .toLowerCase()
    .replaceAll("i think", "")
    .replaceAll("we think", "")
#+END_SRC

Removes conversational phrases that could trigger false positives.

* API Integration

** Request Structure
The thinking budget is passed to the Claude API as part of the request payload:

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
{
  thinking: D > 0 ? { budget_tokens: f, type: "enabled" } : void 0
}
#+END_SRC

** Telemetry
Budget allocation events are tracked via the =tengu_thinking= telemetry system with provider and token count metadata.

* Historical Development

- *v0.2.44*: Initial "think harder" mode introduced
- *v0.2.47*: =MAX_THINKING_TOKENS= environment variable added
- *v0.2.103*: Three-tier budget system established
- *v1.0.8*: Multi-language support expanded to 8 languages
- *v1.0.96*: Mature implementation of multi-tier system
- *v1.0.128*: Final version with legacy multi-language system
- *v2.0.0*: *COMPLETE REDESIGN* - System documented here became obsolete

* Configuration Options

** CLI Integration
The system displays active overrides in the welcome screen including maximum thinking tokens when =MAX_THINKING_TOKENS= is set.

** Debug Mode
Pattern matching results and budget allocations are logged through the telemetry system for debugging purposes.

* Implementation Location (Legacy)

Primary implementation: =archive/pretty/pretty-v1.0.96.js= lines 411705-411874

Key functions:
- =rv()=: Main budget detection with environment override
- =PN5()=: Pattern-based budget detection
- =SN5()=: Multi-language pattern matching
- =TN5()=: Message content extraction

** Migration Path

To use the modern thinking system (v2.0.0+):

1. *Remove legacy keywords*: Replace language-specific phrases with "ultrathink"
2. *Adjust expectations*: No intermediate thinking levels (BASIC, MIDDLE) - only full ultrathink or none
3. *Use tab toggle*: Press Tab in empty input to toggle thinking on/off globally
4. *Environment variable*: =MAX_THINKING_TOKENS= still works for override
5. *Programmatic control*: Use =thinkingMetadata= API instead of text patterns

See ~features/thinking.org~ for current system documentation.
